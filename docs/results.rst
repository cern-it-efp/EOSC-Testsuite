3. Results
---------------------------------------------
Once all tests are run and the test-suite has completed its execution, the results and logs of the validation exercise can be seen at /results in JSON format.
Prior to completing the run, a message will be printed to the console showing the exact path to the results. There you will find a file *general.json* containing general information such as IPs of the provisioned VMs, estimated cost and brief test results information and also a directory *detailed* containing more detailed information for each test.
