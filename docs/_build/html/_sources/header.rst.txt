OCRE Test-Suite for cloud validation - CERN
================================================

This tool is intended to be used for cloud services validation and testing.
When applicable, the test-suite executes four main steps:

1) Infrastructure provisioning: VMs are created using Terraform and then Kubernetes and Docker are installed on them to create a k8s cluster.

2) Deploy the tests: Kubernetes resource definition files (YAML) are used to deploy the tests, either as single pods or deployments.

3) Harvest results: at the end of each test run a result file -written in JSON- is created. This file is stored locally.

4) Through the verification system, the TS is triggered from a service running at CERN. In this case results are then pushed to a S3 Bucket at CERN.

The test set described below available derives from the tests used in `Helix Nebula The Science Cloud <https://www.hnscicloud.eu/>`_ PCP project funded by the European Commission.

**This test-suite has been tested on:**

| Python: 3
| Linux distros: Ubuntu, Centos, Coreos, Debian, RedHat, Fedora
| OS running on provider's VMs : Centos
| Providers:  Exoscale (Cloudstack), CERN Private Cloud (OpenStack), Cloudscale (OpenStack)
